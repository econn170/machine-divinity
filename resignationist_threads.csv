lit,24916299,24918077,,24916474 Austrian economics is invalid from its first premise because it begins with the individual as the primary and ultimate form of analysis In every science the discernment of laws is only possible on a macro level This is especially so in economics where the chaotic and unpredictable actions of individuals create emergent laws which the individuals unknowingly participate in though they themselves but dimly perceive it hence the necessity for the study of economics Austrian school of economics starts at the individual but it doesn't have to end at the individual Many Austrian school economists use macroeconomic data to validate their theories which perhaps stem from a priori reasoning centered around the individual and I don't know why that is so controversial when game theory does exactly the same and it isn't questioned and praxeology could be understood as a precursor of game theory Moreover using data mindlessly to infer correlations can lead you to for example reject the supply demand law because in X circumstances the prices of some product went up with an increasing supply ignoring how the demand which is not easy to measure could have increased at higher rates There are many hidden variables and hidden interactions between variables in the economy which makes virtually impossible to obtain empiric economic laws Unlike with systems in lower order sciences by lower order I mean closer to physics the economy can hardly be confined in an experiment with a controlled atmosphere so that the only variables involved are those whose correlations are desired to be studied That excessively empiricist tendency leads to wanting to statally control the economy because for every positive science there has to be an engineering we have laws to do so right Well that's wrong even from a utilitarian perspective because there are second third and Nth order consequences to intervention which haven't been studied in the empirical models and those consequences don't necessarily have to be lower as the order increases they can wind up to the point of recession And finally the perspective doesn't have to be merely utilitarian because intervention handles the resources of other people and we shouldn't be allowed to do everything in the name of economics just like doctors are not allowed to do medical research with their patients without consent,2025-12-01 09:36:16,resignationist
