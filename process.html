    <h1>Process & Workflow</h1>
    <p>
      I scraped four 4chan boards using the public API, filtered posts through a
      lexicon of mystical and metaphysical terms, and cleaned the resulting text.
      Posts were categorized into conflictual, revelatory, and resignationist
      eschatologies using keyword-based heuristics. I generated embeddings and UMAP
      projections to visualize thematic clusters, then fine-tuned three GPT-Neo
      125M models: one for each eschatology. These models were deployed via a
      FastAPI backend on HuggingFace Spaces and are accessed through this site’s
      interface.
