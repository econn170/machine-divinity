g,107409296,107415731,,107415624 How about you stop being an asshat and suggest a solution There's a couple of reasons why you have shit speakers and can hear a hissing sound 1 Shit speakers It's old like you said so it might have developed the hiss over time This always happens when using an active speaker Since you are using a 3 5mm jack I'm assuming you are using an active speaker and not a passive one 2 Your motherboard audio chip sucks This isn't new all motherboard chips sucks but they did get better over the years The downside to this is that it can amplifying the hissing sound of your speakers 3 Using an audio jack is the worst way to plug speakers in because it sends an analog signal to your speakers which is easier for interference to distort the sound So a couple of ways to fix this Get better speakers This is the expensive method All active speakers will eventually hiss But getting passive speakers can get expensive So your best option is to get speakers and replace them every 15 20 years Another way to combat this is to send a digital signal instead Drop the 3 5mm jack and use either optical or USB cables All modern active speakers should have a USB or optical input If you are dead set on using an analog signal then RCA audio jack Now if you bought an expensive passive speaker that only takes RCA input then you're going to need a DAC to take the digital signal to from your PC convert it to analog then and send it to an amplifier to power your passive speakers This is why passive speakers get expensive So may advice get better speakers that has optical or USB input,2025-12-03 06:35:53,revelatory

lit,24916121,24920708,,24920648 I just reread it for my fanfiction and it has a lot of flaws The prose is quite shit especially at the beginning A lot of repetition and lack of subtlety or subtext Eg We have to do X and Y he said That meant we had to do X and Y He had a face that screamed he needed to do Z because he needed to do Z The first 3 parts have terrible arcs in them The Lutz accusation arc the Lutz escaping arc the Hasse arc The villains are mostly terrible monologuing to hell and back And too many retarded characters in general The world is stupid so Myne can be smart type of deal The story doesn't pick up until the academy arc in part 4 or just before which is indeed 12 volumes in And in the academy arc she suddenly becomes retarded and obsessed with books to a degree that it just becomes annoying Other than its many flaws the overall story is quite good and well planned the worldbuilding is phenomenal and the main character is refreshingly self centered Putting her family to work for her enslaving the orphans not being a piece of wet paper And though it's outside the story the art is really phenomenal and elevates the series by a tremendous amount 24920654 There was no one else in the series that would have fit into the partner role other than him And even then supposedly by the end of p5v12 she isn't even into him it's only him who is extremely horny for her I think the spinoff says something about reciprocation but it's just fan service I mean the fact that it's Hannelore's POV says enough about how much the author cares anymore,2025-12-02 17:35:50,revelatory

lit,24920043,24920117,,24920067 I've been thinking about exactly this same issue and here are the problems as I see it 1 Money is obviously a problem If you want to establish for example a new classically focused university you are going to need a lot of money These days most people are struggling just to get by It takes a lot of mental spiritual strength to simply opt out not to mention the physical toll and safety concerns associated with such a lifestyle So most people do what they can and they complain about what they cannot 2 Following from the first point the economic issues facing the West are systemic and don't have any political fix This is a huge issue that I haven't seen anybody willing to publicly address but the world has moved on in the last fifty years and the Western world is no longer indisputably a better place to live In fact most talent and money is currently moving out of it at a dizzying speed And I'm not going to sugar coat this point but it comes down to a single crucial variable the cost of labor A factory paying it's employees 25 dollars an hour simply cannot compete with a factory that can afford to pay its employees 5 an hour So what needs to happen is for Western workers to take a huge hit in their quality of life ability to afford goods and services etc But your average wagie is already worked to the bone just to pay their bills so you also need to massively cut the rate of profit for food rent transportation etc But obviously the powers that be and I'm talking about your local city representatives the people who you could go up and knock on their door tomorrow and argue this point with them yourself so don't fall into that trap of conspiratorial thinking where nobody is responsible for anything the powers that be are completely unwilling to commit to a plan that would for example decrease the property value ten fold And for good reason this would cause an economic death spiral and completely wipe out Western nations and governments So what do we do Grit our teeth and just accept the decline I guess and it can either be hard and fast or slow and drawn out but it's going to happen and there's not a single thing we can do about it I have ideas for things I personally would change Ideas for new modalities of conducting politics But obviously I don't want to go into too much detail here But at the end of the day we still need to eat so that will always be a concern 4chan in general is a good platform to crowdsource punditry Most of my most successful opinions I've stolen verbatim from this place Any time I've thinking of a new piece of demagoguery I come here to workshop it The medium is the problem I guess One last note concerning long term visions All changes are short term over a long enough time frame Starting a family is almost certainly more long lasting than just about any other endeavour I can think of you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss it,2025-12-02 10:22:27,revelatory

lit,24920061,24921325,,24920061 The other day I happened to take up Milton's Paradise Lost which threw me into strange contemplations In this as in all other productions of modern art it is the personality of the artist that gives interest to his work The subject is detestable externally not without a certain imposing grandeur but internally worm eaten and hollow The springs of action and the situations that belong to them are in some few cases natural and effective but the majority are lame and false and give one pain to realise At the same time it is an interesting man who speaks to us character feeling understanding learning poetical and oratorical genius and other excellent qualities he undoubtedly possesses in no common measure Nay more the singular accident that as a revolutionary politician he paints the devil with more effective touches than the angels has a great influence on the design and composition of the poem and again the accident of the writer being blind adds not a little to the tone and colour of the book Paradise Lost therefore notwithstanding its radical defects as a work of art will maintain its place triumphantly in virtue of the majestic personality which it reveals I have lately read his 'Samson ' which has more of the antique spirit than any production of any other modern poet He is very great and his own blindness enabled him to describe with so much truth the situation of Samson Milton was really a poet one to whom we owe all possible respect,2025-12-02 22:10:43,revelatory
