    <h1>About the Project</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Machine Divinity</strong> is a computational-artistic exploration of mystical,
      apocalyptic, and psychosis-coded language across anonymous online spaces. The project
      analyzes 4chan discourse through an eschatological framework and trains three generative
      “oracles,” each representing a distinct linguistic worldview.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the homepage, users can choose between three oracles—<strong>revelatory</strong>,
      <strong>conflictual</strong>, or <strong>resignationist</strong>. These categories are drawn
      from Petersen &amp; Baun’s (2025) study of the /pol/ board, where they identified three
      eschatological formations tied to different conceptions of agency, crisis, and symbolic meaning.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is an Eschatology?</h2>

    <p>
      Eschatology refers to beliefs about endings, or <em>“the part of theology concerned with death,
      judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind.”</em> Petersen &amp; Baun’s analysis of
      4chan posts (2014–2023) found a rise in eschatological worldviews, which they argue reflects
      <em>“ideological adaptations to the increasing complexity and scope of societal issues,
      as perceived by the community.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      While this project began as an exploration of “spiritual” language on 4chan more broadly, the
      eschatological framework offered a compelling structure through which to interpret emergent forms
      of digital mysticism, revelation, and doom.
    </p>

    <h2>What Do the Buttons Do?</h2>

    <p>
      Each oracle button corresponds to a language model trained on posts classified within one of the
      three eschatological categories. When you choose an oracle, you are selecting its worldview:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conflictual eschatology</strong>: violent transformation, war, destruction.</li>
      <li><strong>Revelatory eschatology</strong>: awakening, hidden truths, prophecy, metaphysical revelation.</li>
      <li><strong>Resignationist eschatology</strong>: passive metaphysical doom, dissociation, ego death.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Choose an eschatology, write your prompt, and receive your prophecy.
