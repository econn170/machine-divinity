    <h1>About the Project</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Machine Divinity</strong> is a computational-artistic investigation into mystical,
      apocalyptic, and psychosis-coded language across anonymous online communities. The project
      uses a dataset of 4chan posts filtered for esoteric and metaphysical vocabulary, and explores
      how users construct symbolic worlds through language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inspired by recent work on digital esotericism and eschatological discourse, the project
      transforms these linguistic worlds into generative “oracles” trained on themed subsets of
      the corpus. Each oracle represents a different
      worldview discovered within the dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website interface allows visitors to interact with these oracles, prompting them to
      speak in the distinctive style of their eschatological category. This invites reflection on
      how collective language online forms emergent symbolic entities, or what might be thought
      of as digital egregores.
