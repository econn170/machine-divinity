    <h1>What Is an Eschatology?</h1>

    <p>
     Eschatology refers to beliefs about endings, or, “the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind”.
     The categories you see on the homepage are drawn from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xmet7it0taDf8vJBMNLerx9kJGOv39U3/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">a recent paper by Peterson & Baun</a>, where they identified three eschatological formations on the 4chan board /pol/. Each one is tied to different conceptions of agency and crisis:

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conflictual</strong>: violence, war, destruction, civilizational collapse</li>
      <li><strong>Revelatory</strong>: awakening, hidden truth, prophecy, metaphysical insight</li>
      <li><strong>Resignationist</strong>: passive doom, ego dissolution, unreality, dissociation</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Peterson & Baun found, through an analysis of 4chan posts from 2014-2023, an increase of eschatological frameworks over time, “[reflecting] ideological adaptations to the increasing complexity and scope of societal issues,  as perceived by the community” (2025). This project began with me exploring “spiritual” language on 4chan broadly, but I was fascinated by Peterson & Baun’s findings and thought they would be a great framework for my data. 


    <h2>How the Oracles Work</h2>

    <p>
      Each oracle on the homepage corresponds to a language model trained on posts associated with one of
      these eschatological worldviews. The model you choose determines the “voice” and symbolic logic of 
      the prophecy it generates.
