lit,24868365,24886227,,24884369 I think finding a different viewpoint is easiest in earlier fantasy before the standardization took over For example Clark Ashton Smith's Zothique stories present a non Western styled fantasy world quite far removed from the current Californian sensibilities The stories are short individually and unconnected to each other but reading them together gives a sense of a world The Night Land by William Hope Hodgson may be difficult to read and has its flaws but the worldbuilding of the sunless world first appearing in Chapter 2 is unique and compelling For something newer and of a different sort something like the Earthsea trilogy I personally think the subsequent sequels are best treated as not existing by Ursula LeGuin could be mentioned Patricia A McKillip has some interesting but lightly detailed worldbuilding in short books too Tolkien himself is very much worth reading too to see how he compares to his imitators and how much depth has been lost following the standard formula Most authors not in the vein of Tolkien don't really worldbuild that much but you can still get valuable different perspectives from say the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen which have mature and often religious themes as originally written not as adapted by Disney or the like I have read some books by Brandon Sanderson but haven't touched the Stormlight Archive series I classify Sanderson as the guy who develops really neat magic systems,2025-11-16 23:39:28,conflictual

lit,24868365,24906955,,24906541 Also I have several different worlds I work on simultaneously one in which magic is virtually unexplained and another where I try to actually create rules Both are fine approaches imo Here's what I have for the rules one there are 3 components to casting spells 1 the hand signs every spell requires dexterous use the the fingers and hands to do complex motions words do not accompany this btw it's basically silent 2 fuel nearly all magic requires some form of equivalent exchange to cast the spell that's needed Can be as simple as a pinecone to light on fire for a fireball ala gandalf or as complicated as a whole collection of dragon parts to idk do something important and spooky like create an army of skeletons there's one inside you right now btw 3 knowledge of the spell reading it in a tome and understanding the logic behind it and how the spell physically manifests So with all those 3 basically it looks like this in order to cast a levitate spell the magician needs a bird feather a quick right hand motion and the knowledge of exactly when to let go of the feather so it turns into wind or whatever I think the intresting thing about this is that the 3 different parts can pull different amounts of weight for each spell and will inevitably come from 3 different types of magicians For example this spell can be made more powerful by using more feathers thus a wealthy magician can just throw more feathers at his problems and make it work Meanwhile a magician who has KNOWLEDGE would know that some bird feathers behave differently than others because he studied the spell for a long time and knows how to cast it the most efficiently by maximizing different aspects Meanwhile meanwhile you can have someone who is incredibly dexterous with their fingers and can thus pull as much magic out of that one feather as possible because their casting was so exact that their one feather effectively behave like a dozen from the resource fag and a special eagle wing brown feather from the knowledge fag In this system all people who use magic are called magicians but there is a ven diagram like spectrum where people who prioritize different methods are labeled differently These are not set in stone yet but for example resourcefaggots are called mages and are generally looked down upon by other types because they're like rich nepobabies who bought their way into magic fingerfaggots are called warlocks and are generally respected for their skill but considered unrefined and uncultured by the others This method is often used by the poor knowledgefaggots are called wizards and are what is often traditionally associated with magicians Towers hoarding tomes experimenting with random bullshit the whole shebang They're like the propee high society of magicians Because of this all obviously the most powerful and thus potentially the most dangerous magician are people who have all 3,2025-11-26 10:25:09,conflictual
